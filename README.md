# Bayesian-Robust-Principal-Component-Analysis
- R, Rcpp, and Stan codes for my ongoing research project: "Bayesian Robust Principal Component Analysis".
- In this project, we are implementing a Bayesian model for high-dimensional noisy matrix decomposition problem, where the sparsity support is unknown and needs to be learned from the data. Our model solves many existing issues (e.g., identifiability, rank-sparsity incoherence, etc.) in the literature. We will also prove high-dimensional posterior consistency and establish the validity of MCMC estimates.
- This project is currently ongoing under the supervision of Dr. Kshitij Khare and Dr. George Michailidis in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida.
- Sourav Mukherjee is the sole contributor in writing the codes and doing the simulations in this research project.
